# Create an RStudio SErver on Digital Ocean

## Purpose 
These instructions will guide you to set up an RStudio server on DigitalOcean. Running data science code on a cloud platform allows you to run processes that require more resources than are available on your local computer or processes that will require more time than your local computer. The advantage of using RStudio is that it provides an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is identical to the desktop version of RStudio, which minimizes the amount of time you will spend learning to work in a new environment. I use RStudio over other IDEs because it provides a good user interface for finding/interacting with files, viewing outputs, writing scripts, using both *R* and terminal consoles. 

By the end of these instructions, you will have a fully configured ready-to-run RStudio server on which you can set up multiple users and on which you can use the modern workspace and file hosting service **Dropbox**. 

## Prerequisites 
(1) Set up a digital ocean droplet that has at least 2GB of RAM.

Configure this droplet. See the instructions from Digital Ocean on [the initial server setup with Ubuntu 18.04 ](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04). 

(2) You should also have a passing familiarty with [*Nginx*](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-nginx/#:~:text=Nginx%2C%20pronounced%20like%20%E2%80%9Cengine%2D,HTTP%20cache%2C%20and%20load%20balancer.&text=Nginx%20was%20originally%20created%20by,public%20release%20in%20October%202004.) (pronounced *engine-x**) or [Apache](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-apache/). I will use Nginx in this tutorial because (1) I am more familiar with it than Apache and (2) it is far more versatile. 

## General Approach 
I approach this processs working from Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to a more finished product. The MVP is a *RStudio* server that we can access via the IP Address. The more-finished- ersion uses Nginx as a reverse proxy server and a custom URL. 

## Set Up *R*
The first step in this process is to install R, RStudio, and Shiny.  I am basing these processes on the steps outlined by [RStudio](https://web.archive.org/web/20200425074931/https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server/debian-ubuntu/). 

```zsh
#Install R-Base
sudo apt-get install r-base
```
